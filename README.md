# core8

**core8** is a small interpreter that emulates the chip8 platform. This project is a C++ lib that offers a virtual machine able to run chip8 binaries. The **core8**'s VM uses a simple I/O interface which can be easily connected to a graphical user interface so it can act as an engine for a chip8 emulator.

The **core8** lib is written in C++14.
